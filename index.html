                        The average trench is roughly 100 ft and takes around 12 hours to dig, on average soldiers would dig around 10 ft every hour! This was not easy because there would always be tricky obstacles like hard rock that would require a lot of mining to dig out! It would take up to 450 soldiers to dig this trench which is quite a lot, and the longest trench is over 470 miles!

People normally where a little poppy just under the collar to pay respects for soldiers.

                        The first ever tank was built in Britain in 1915 and it was called the "Little Willie", however it was never used in combat! Germany managed to deploy 21 tanks during the span of World War 1 however Britain and France managed to produce up to 7,000 tanks. They never used the Tank as a weapon because it's first tank battle was in World War 2. Throughout the entirety of World War 1 the tank was never developed into a good or effective weapon! The first tank weighed 16 tons, measured up to 8 meters in length and could travel up to 3.2 k/h. Although they didn't fight with tanks it had a massive impact on the war as it provided for good mobility on the western front.

                        There were many medicines taken during World War 1 however one problem that couldn't be fixed with medicine was "Shell Shock" a physiological illness where soldiers would feel great fear due to conditions from the war. The problem with medicine is that soldiers needed it so fast so they can get back to fighting in the war, this is why female volunteers decided to take care of sick or injured soldiers and drive the ambulances. Most nurses and doctors worked up to 14 hours a day! As for medicine they would often have to perform blood transfusions to stop any poison or infection spreading.
